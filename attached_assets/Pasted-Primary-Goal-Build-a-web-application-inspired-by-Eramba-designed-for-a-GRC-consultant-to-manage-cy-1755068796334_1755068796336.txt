Primary Goal: Build a web application inspired by Eramba, designed for a GRC consultant to manage cybersecurity compliance for multiple client companies. The application must be secure, intuitive, and scalable.

Core Application Features:
1. Multi-Tenant Organization Management:

The super-admin (the primary user) must be able to create, view, and manage multiple, distinct "Organizations" (these are the client companies).

All data, including users, documents, risks, and controls, must be strictly isolated and belong to a single Organization. Users from one Organization should never see data from another.

2. User Roles and Approval Workflows:

Implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system within each Organization with at least these roles:

Admin: Full control over their Organization's settings, users, and content.

Contributor: Can create and edit draft documents and risks but cannot approve or publish them.

Approver: Can review submissions from Contributors and approve or reject them.

Read-Only: Can view published documents and risks but cannot make any changes.

Approval System: This is critical.

When a Contributor creates or edits a GRC document (e.g., a policy) or a risk register entry, it must be in a "Draft" status.

The Contributor must be able to submit the Draft for approval.

The submission must go to a designated Approver (or a group of Approvers).

The Approver can review the draft, add comments, and either "Approve" or "Reject" it.

If rejected, the document returns to "Draft" status for the Contributor to revise.

If approved, the document's status changes to "Published," and it becomes the official, read-only version for all users in that Organization.

Maintain a version history for all published documents.

3. GRC Documentation Module:

A central repository within each Organization for creating and managing GRC documents like policies, standards, and procedures.

Use a rich-text editor (like TinyMCE or Quill.js) for document creation.

Each document must have a title, owner, version, status (Draft, Pending Approval, Published, Archived), and be mapped to specific controls from the frameworks.

Implement the multi-step approval workflow described above.

4. Risk Register Module:

A dedicated module for managing a risk register for each Organization.

Each risk entry should include: Risk ID, Description, Owner, Impact, Likelihood, Risk Score (calculated), Mitigation Plan, and Status.

The risk register must also use the same multi-step approval workflow as the documentation module.

5. Cybersecurity Frameworks & Controls:

The application must come pre-loaded with a library of common cybersecurity frameworks and their associated controls.

Admins should be able to activate or deactivate specific frameworks for their Organization.

Users must be able to map their GRC documents and risk entries to one or more controls from these frameworks.

6. CSV Import Functionality:

This is a core requirement. The application must allow an Admin to bulk-import data using CSV files.

Provide separate CSV import capabilities for:

Compliance Frameworks (Framework Name, Control ID, Control Description).

Risk Registers (all risk fields).

Provide downloadable CSV templates for users to ensure correct formatting.

Initial Data Seeding:
Upon initial database migration, please pre-populate the frameworks table with the following major GRC standards and their controls (you can use placeholder text for the full list of controls for now):

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

ISO/IEC 27001:2022

SOC 2 (Trust Services Criteria: Security, Availability, Confidentiality, Processing Integrity, Privacy)

PCI DSS v4.0

CIS Critical Security Controls v8

GDPR

HIPAA (Security Rule)
